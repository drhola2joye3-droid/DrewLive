Everyone takes their seats, and the kid with the colorful outfit, whom Team Urameshi met last night, Rinku, steps up to take the first match. Since Yusuke still seems to be asleep, Kuwabara takes the first match. The match begins, and Rinku demonstrates his incredible speed by running in flashes around Kuwabara. Kuwabara's training pays off, however, when he can easily detect Rinku's movements. He deals him a few crushing blows, and it looks like Rinku is down. He grins, though, standing back up and telling Kuwabara he was just playing around to begin. He reveals his true weapon, eight Yo-Yos, four for each hand. He launches them forward to Kuwabara. Kuwabara reveals his newly-improved weapon, double Spirit Swords.",

Uh-oh. To make matters worse, the next member, Touya is ready to fight and avenge his dead teammate. Touya attacks just as Gama's first spell wears off, allowing him to move, but with his energy still sealed, he's still in a bad situation. Kurama spends all of the time trying to keep himself from getting killed by Touya's attacks. Eventually, he forms a plan to defeat Touya, and gets himself cut on purpose to plant one of his death plant seeds inside his own body right so it can manifest as a weapon.",

All of a sudden Yusuke says, \"\"Time for something stupid.\"\" His body becomes surrounded with spirit energy. Everyone is surprised-Botan, Kuwabara, Kayko, Koenma. Then Jin attacks with the first tornado fist. Yusuke somehow catches the fist. Jin exclaims, \"\"No one can catch a tornado!\"\" Yusuke throws the fist, rendering it useless. When Jin attacks with the second fist, Yusuke catches it with his foot. He also makes the Tornado Fist useless. He yells, \"\"SPIRIT WAVE\"\" and a punch full of blue energy nails Jin right in the stomach. Jin goes flying in the air. The Masked Fighter explains that the Spirit Wave is like Yusuke's shotgun attack and that he must have learned it from Genkai. In the stands, Kayko is shocked, but Shizuru says, \"\"Let's move.\"\" All of a sudden, a sparkle is seen in the sky and Jin's body comes crashing down in the stands. Koto makes a ten count, and Yusuke is the winner.",
